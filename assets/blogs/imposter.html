                    As we delve deep into the word of code complex buzzwords like algorithms, data structures, artificial intellegence, machine learning are always being thrown 
                    around left and right. It seems like neural networks and deep learing is all people are talking about these days. Now although these words seem super cool and 
                    all to people but for someone who is new and has just started to get into development this seems like a big hurdle to pass. Once they start getting the hang of 
                    the basics it time to move into the intermediate to advanced stuff and for a lot of folks a little something called <span class="container-body-subhead">Imposter Syndrome</span> 
                    just bashes in through the door making its presense not only known but felt!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another buzzword now, this time around it’s “Imposter Syndrome”. In it’s essense Imposter Syndrome is just the feeling of not beloning somewhere. What happens 
                    usually is that we get stuck on a problem, we try everythhing we know but it seems like we just can’t make it past. Then once we start looking for solutions online 
                    we see so many people have seemingly simple answers to out issue, answers that make us feel like “well I could have done that, its so simple! Am I just now cut out for 
                    this?”. This one singular tought has come to almost every single programmers mind. Even people that aren’t developers have had this.

                <p>
                    Now, I can’t speak for others and how they manage it but the way I go about it is I make a list of the simple steps needed to get the job done. Think of it this way, 
                    if you were to bake a cake you’d need a recepie. You would then follow that and bake your cake. Do the same here, make a list of the simple steps needed to get the job done.
                    <br /> For eg: To build a calculator
                </p>

                <ul class="container-body-ul">
                    <li>
                        You’d have to first get the users input, for that you’d need some type of an input form. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Then get that user input validate it and process it for addition, multiplication etc. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Once that’s done you would just show the output to the user.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    You should always break down a bigger problem into smaller simpler ones. Doing this not only makes the whole process simpler but gives you a clear idea of what 
                    should and needs to be done. So, just keep at it. Even professionals who have been at it for years get into problems and bugs that makes them pull their hair out!
                    The reality is theres only one way of getting throught it and that’s to keep practicing.
